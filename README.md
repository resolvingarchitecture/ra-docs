# Resolving Architecture Documentation
Documentation on how to use these services.

## Quick Start

## Foundation
* [SEDA Bus - Java](https://github.com/resolvingarchitecture/seda-bus-java) is the foundational repository for Java-based dapps which all message integration occurs between services.
* [Service Bus - Java](https://github.com/resolvingarchitecture/service-bus-java) sits on top of SEDA Bus using it to pass messages between services. The service bus provides registration of services and a simple router to route messages between services. More complex routing can be provided as a service. Service monitoring and adminstration is handled by the service bus.
